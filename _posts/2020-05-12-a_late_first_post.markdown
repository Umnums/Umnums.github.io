So I've been bad about blogging - talking about myself and my accomplishments has never been a strong suit of mine. So instead of my first post being about why I've gotten into coding (a love for puzzles and problem solving - just like everyone else on here), I'll be talking about my CLI Ruby app that I've created.

Ultimate frisbee (and all sports, really) and coding in that when it is well done, it should look simple and elegant while simultaneously being quite complex. My enjoyment for ultimate is what inspired me to write a CLI app to give details on pickup ultimate games via pickupultimate.com.

The website was originally developed by a fellow coder from Houston, and is also his passion project. It provides details on games nearby that are up-to-date (games must be updated every 100 days to stay listed), and is a great resource to find games while travelling or if you have recently moved. By scraping his website, I was able to create a CLI app that helps find games in a city near you.
